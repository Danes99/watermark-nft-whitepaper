# Business Benefits

By using this new NFT norm, we compensate for the existing security in the NFT ecosystem. It first replaces the one-way relationship between the smart contract and the file by a bi-directional relationship between the smart contract and the file with the NFT creator/minter private key as the link. The smart contract contains the file hash (unidirectional link from the file to smart contract) and the file contains the ownership transfer transaction hash (unidirectional link from the smart contract to the file) thus resulting with a bi-directional link between the smart contract and the file.

From a security standpoint, we now have non-repudiation intrinsically embedded in the NFT file thanks to steganography and the signed ownership meta-data. Any entity can audit the file to check its authenticity.

We have traceability embedded thanks to the “Ownership-Chain”. It specifies the chain of ownership over time. It is secured by existing cryptographic functions and reproduces the blockchain block linking but with files instead of raw text.

The ownership transfer process mimics the real-world process of assets ownership transfer. It is a two step process beginning with the transfer of the token by the current owner and ending with the new ownership certification by the new owner.

This new NFT norm can be easily integrated by any NFT ecosystem because it is built upon existing NFT norm and process. It can incentivize several existing platforms to adopt this
norm.
