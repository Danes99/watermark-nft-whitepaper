# Problem Definition

## Plagiarism and fraud

We have read many examples of artists having their work copied without permission and sold as an NFT. After the artist Qing Han died in 2020, her identity was assumed by a fraudster and several of her works became available for purchase as NFTs. Even if the piece is already available as an NFT, a fraudster can “mint” a new NFT linking to the same file using the same hypertext link.

Similarly, a seller posing as Banksy succeeded in selling an NFT supposedly made by the artist for $336,000 in 2021, with the seller in this case refunding the money after the case drew media attention.

A process known as "sleep minting" can also allow a fraudster to mint an NFT in an artist's wallet and transfer it back to their own account without the artist becoming aware. This allowed a white hat hacker to mint a fraudulent NFT that had seemingly originated from the wallet of the artist Beeple.

## Problem root causes

One of the main problems of NFTs is that the original file link between the token smart contract certificate and the hosted file storage system is unidirectional. The only thing linking them is a URL link stored as a string in the smart contract metadata. If the link dies, the data source is changed or a fraudulent actor could execute a counterfeit smart contract pointing to the same URL Link, the integrity of the NFTs is undermined.

To solve this problem, the approach is to build a solution that guarantees the integrity of the entire NFT metadata. Each person has their own unique style of handwriting, whether it is everyday handwriting or their personal signature.

Cultural environment and the characteristics of the written form of the first language that one learns to write are the primary influences on the development of one's own unique handwriting style. Even identical twins who share appearance and genetics do not have the same handwriting. Because each person's handwriting is unique and different, it can be used to verify a document’s writer.

Moreover, for NFTs to be adopted by institutions, the solution needs to guarantee the integrity of the NFT’s metadata as previously described.

The solution needs to be open, transparent, and easily auditable to be adopted by platforms and used just like a person opening a JPEG file on his computer.
