# Introduction

## NFT

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique token representing an anchored unit of data stored in a digital distributed ledger (blockchain). NFT are a part of an associated reproducible file such as photos, videos, audios, and other types of digital files considered as unique items (like certificates of authenticity) and use blockchain technology to provide a public proof of ownership.

A copy of the original file is not limited to the NFT owner and can be copied and shared like any other file. The lack of interchangeability (fungibility distinguishes NFTs from blockchain cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum which are fungibles.
The first NFT project, [Cryptokitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) took place on the Ethereum blockchain in 2015 and has since grown into an important sector of the Western art industry.

## Centralized File Storage

The current architecture of NFTs usually do not store files on the blockchain due to the Blockchain capabilities to not store important data size. The token acts like a certificate of ownership and is linked to a URL address that points to the tokenized file in question, but the original file remains subject to « link rot ».

A link rot (also called link death, link breaking, or reference rot) are hyperlinking phenomena that cause this file source to move to a new URL address and/or becoming potentially a permanent unreachable link. No centralized service could be available forever. URL links that no longer point to a destination are often referred to as broken or dead links (or orphaned links).

In the past, some NFTs were permanently disabled due to the use of non-redundant off-chain storage. Blockchain networks (like Ethereum) have limited storage capacity (few kilobytes).

For that reason, an on-chain NFT network where all media metadata are referenced directly in the associated token smart contract which is not common because the data is currently stored on an off-chain network (AWS server, IPFS, etc.).

Developing an on-chain NFTs network could be completely secure, more difficult to hack and be always reachable online. Compared to an off-chain solution with higher censorship risk (e.g., off-chain metadata can be altered, lost to a project that goes bust, censored by AWS, etc.).

## Decentralized File Storage

To counter this phenomenon, files are usually stored in a decentralized and secure file system such as IPFS (Interplanetary File System). The Interplanetary File System is a peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed way. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices. This hybrid approach provides developers with ease of use and flexibility.

Because tokens are functionally separate from the underlying file, anybody can easily save a copy of an NTfs file, popularly through a right click. NFT supporters disparage this duplication of NFT artwork as a "right-clicker mentality", with one collector comparing the value of a purchased NFT to that of a status symbol "to show off that they can afford to pay that much".

The "right-clicker mentality" phrase spread virally after its introduction, particularly among those that were critical of the NFT marketplace who used the term to flaunt the ability to capture digital art backed by NFT with ease.
